build fails with weird errors:
    In file included from ./config.h:6,
		     from ../../gcc/c/c-lang.c:21:
    ./auto-host.h:2545:16: error: declaration does not declare anything [-fpermissive]
     2545 | #define rlim_t long

    In file included from ../../gcc/c/c-lang.c:22:
    ../../gcc/system.h:495:14: error: conflicting declaration of C function 'void* sbrk(int)'

	  |              ^~~~
    In file included from ../../gcc/system.h:301,

    /mnt/lfs/usr/include/unistd.h:1076:14: note: previous declaration 'void* sbrk(intptr_t)'
     1076 | extern void *sbrk (intptr_t __delta) __THROW;
	  |              ^~~~
    ...

suspect that all the errors are coming from the same root cause.
Verified that gcc/configure does not discover a system declaration of sbrk,
and substitutes one from the gcc codebase.

The gcc-provided declaration is here:
    gcc-11.2.0/gcc/system.h
The kernel-header version is here:
    /mnt/lfs/usr/include/unistd.h

perhaps gcc/configure only looks in /usr/include/unistd.h,   which doesn't exist
on a nixos host.   If this is the case,  it's a bug that you might not encounter on
a typical linux host
