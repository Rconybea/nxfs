- FALSE ALARM
  ncurses build fails because stdc++ installed to /mnt/lfs/..../c++/include;
  fix by installing to /mnt/lfs/..../include instead.

  This was actually because stdc++ was installed to the wrong directory
  (was failing to propagate ${gcc_version} shell variable)

- bash build fails building symlink for /bin/bash,  because /mnt/lfs/bin doesn't exist.
  also link is broken since /mnt/lfs/bin/bash doesn't exist;
  replace by symlink to /usr/bin/bash (which will be unbroken in chroot environment)
