binutils,  for linux-from-scratch build.

nix only wants to install to /nix/store paths;
it has active countermeasures for any attempts to get-out-of-jail.
That affects us,  because we want to install to /mnt/lfs/tools
Instead of having nix perform the final install,
we have it copy the build state after compiling, to the (nix-store-located) output directory.
This is done by:
  $ cd binutils
  $ nix-build

Then from outside nix,   can run that install step:
  $ cd binutils
  $ ./final-install.sh
