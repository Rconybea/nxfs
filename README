TODO: switch S0 to lfs user instead of sudo

motivation:

linuxfromscratch is educational -- see how a linux system is put together.
introducing nix for similar reasons:  to learn how to put things together using nix.

changes from LFS book:
1. will do all building from nix derivations.
   This means we construct derivations for linux used to bootstrap
   (in this case,  nixos 21.0)

changes from usual nix packaging:
2. packages (hello, binutils, gcc, ..)
   will need to install to LFS tools area /mnt/lfs/tools;
   this can't be in nix store.

   nix build will preserve both source+build directories as nix output,
   so that we can run 'make install' from outside nix shell.

   Need this because nix build is sandboxed,   and cannot write to non-nix-store
   directories like /mnt/lfs/tools

3. use
     $ nix-shell . -A gcc_lfsx_stage1 --pure --run genericBuild
   to get the effect of a nix build,  without sandboxing.
   sandboxing prevents nix-build from reading/writing /mnt/lfs
   can run path/to/codebase/lfs-build.sh to get something similar

Instructions:
P0. prepare /mnt/lfs/ directory as per LFS book

S0. gnu hello.
    provides some evidence that some primary build dependencies are present;
    exercises gcc and autotools without adding any baggage.
    the 'hello' package isn't a dependency of anything else
    
    will require:
    - local nix install
    - network access (to ftp.gnu.org)
    - gcc, autotools

    make stage1 hello -> /mnt/lfs/tools.
     $ nix-build -A hello
     $ sudo ./hello/final-install.sh

    note: this step relies on:

    - nxfs/default.nix                \
    - nxfs/hello/default.nix          |
    - nxfs/hello/autotools.nix        | used by nix-build -A hello
    - nxfs/hello/builder.sh           |
    - nxfs/hello/setup.sh             /

S1. gnu binutils (can skip this step,  keeping here for demo purposes)

    make stage1 binutils -> /mnt/lfs/tools
     $ nix-build -A binutils_lfsx_stage1

    if you want to install straight to /mnt/lfs,  can use this
    after reviewing/editing binutils/setup.sh:
     $ sudo ./binutils/final-install.sh

   source files (.nix, .sh) parallel the setup for S0
   the 'binutils' package isn't a dependency of anything else;
   it's folded into the 'gcc' package

S2 gcc+binutils

   make stage1 gcc -> /mnt/lfs/tools
     $ ./gcc/lfs-build.sh

   source files (.nix, .sh) parallel the setup for S0

S3. linux headers (linux)

   prep kernel headers -> /mnt/lfs
     $ ./linux/lfs-build.sh
   

S4. gnu libc (glibc)

   make stage1 glibc -> /mnt/lfs
     $ ./glibc/lfs-build.sh

S5. gnu stdc++ library (stdc++)

   make stage1 stdc++ -> /mnt/lfs
     $ ./stdc++/lfs-build.sh
     
S6. various other packages needed in stage1
     $ ./m4/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./ncurses/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./bash/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./coreutils/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./diffutils/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./file/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./findutils/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./gawk/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./grep/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./gzip/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./make/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./patch/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./sed/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./tar/lfs-build.sh
     $ ./xz/lfs-build.sh

S7. binutils stage2

    make binutils -> /mnt/lfs;  build using stage1 cross-compiler
      $ ./stage2/binutils/lfs-build.sh

S8. gcc stage2

    make gcc -> /mnt/lfs;  build using stage1 cross-compiler
      $ ./stage2/gcc/lfs-build.sh
